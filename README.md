## Starting the dev environment

To work out what version of python you have:

```bash
python --version
```

If you have python@2:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

or python@3:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

If you don't have python, create a webserver with the root folder of this repo as the root of your webserver.

Then open a browser to: [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
